# PONG
Create the game, PONG. PONG is a simple game where it emulates playing table tennis. Will look at various codes to see how others are writing their code and seeing what type of programs they are using. 

Will be using pygames and VisualStudios to write and run the game. Seems like a lot of GitHub users are using this for simple games they have created.

Will use the basic black background with a 800X600 window to run the game. Would like to have a yellow and white paddle to go use KSU themed colors. Some creators are using a square "ball" but we will use a circular ball. 

Project being worked on by Kyle and Joe.
